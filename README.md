# HW12

unzip CameraSheningans and app zip files, and place the app folder into the CameraSheningans folder. The folder is now available to work on in Gradle.

I have added soe code to get me two points on the scrren that monitor the dark pixels, and I am computing the angle that is created by the line on my screen. Based on the angle that I compute and the angle that my phone makes with the ground (to be determined shorlty) I will compute the raw angle of the dark line on the ground.
